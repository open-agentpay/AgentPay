"""
Optional policy-engine extension for credential-mode (non-402) calls.

Some gateways accept a pre-issued credential (e.g. ``X-Agent-Key``) and answer
200 directly, so the HTTP 402 flow never starts and ``reserve()`` is never
reached.  Engines that implement this protocol can still meter those calls:

    reserve_metered()  -> reserve an *estimated* amount BEFORE the request is sent
    settle_metered()   -> record the real cost (or keep the estimate) afterwards

Release / failure bookkeeping reuses ``IPolicyEngine.release`` and
``record_failure``.
